### Disclaimer

This is currently a **Work In Progress**

### Motivation

- I wasn't able to find a theme that supported all different typing systems (Vanilla, Flow, Typescript, Reason) conveniently.
- Most of the theme I've encountered suffered from a bad contrast between colors. That is particularly annoying if you are colorblind.
- I wanted to have a theme well suited for the React ecosystem (good JSX support for instance)
